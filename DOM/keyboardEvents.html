    <!-- When you press a character key once on the keyboard, 
     three keyboard events are fired in the following order:
    1. keydown (fires repetedly)
    2. keypress
    3. keyup (fires repetedly) 
    
    Keydown and keypress are fired before anyy change is made to the textbox
    Key up fires after changes have been made to textbox
    
    When you press a non-character key, 
    the keydown event is fired first followed by the keyup event. 
    If you hold down the non-character key, the keydown is fired repeatedly until you release the key.
