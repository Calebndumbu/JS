# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game that allows a human player to play against the computer through the browser console. The game is played over five rounds, with scores tracked for both the human and computer players.

## Project Setup and Structure

### Step 1: Setup the Project Structure

1. **Initialize the Git Repository**:

   - Start a new Git repository for this project.
   - Remember to commit early and often to document your progress.

2. **HTML and JavaScript Setup**:
   - Create a blank `index.html` file with a `<script>` tag to include your JavaScript.
   - Link an external JavaScript file to keep your HTML clean and organized.
   - Confirm that JavaScript is linked correctly by logging "Hello World" in the console:
     ```javascript
     console.log("Hello World");
     ```
   - Open the browser console to ensure that the message is displayed correctly.

### Step 2: Generate the Computer's Choice

1. **Create the `getComputerChoice` Function**:
   - This function returns a random choice of "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
   - Use `Math.random()` to help randomize the choice.
   - Test the function with `console.log(getComputerChoice());` to confirm that it returns a random choice.

### Step 3: Get the Human Choice

1. **Create the `getHumanChoice` Function**:
   - This function prompts the player to enter "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
   - Make the function case-insensitive, so any capitalization of the choices is valid.
   - Test the function by logging the player’s input to the console.

### Step 4: Score Tracking

1. **Declare Score Variables**:
   - Create two global variables, `humanScore` and `computerScore`, and initialize them to 0.
   - These variables will be updated as rounds are played.

### Step 5: Play a Single Round

1. **Create the `playRound` Function**:

   - This function compares the human and computer choices, determines the winner, and increments the winner’s score.
   - Use parameters `humanChoice` and `computerChoice` to accept the choices for each round.
   - Log the round result (e.g., “You lose! Paper beats Rock”) in the console.
   - Example code:

     ```javascript
     function playRound(humanChoice, computerChoice) {
       // Compare choices and update scores
     }

     const humanSelection = getHumanChoice();
     const computerSelection = getComputerChoice();
     playRound(humanSelection, computerSelection);
     ```

### Step 6: Play the Entire Game

1. **Create the `playGame` Function**:
   - This function will play a total of 5 rounds, calling `playRound` each time and keeping track of the scores.
   - At the end of 5 rounds, it announces the overall winner based on the final scores.
   - Use a loop to play multiple rounds if you're familiar with loops; otherwise, call `playRound` manually five times.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Open the browser console (usually `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+J`).
3. Run `playGame()` in the console to start the game.

## Notes

- This game is designed to be played in the browser console.
- As you work on this project, commit your code regularly for better tracking of changes.
